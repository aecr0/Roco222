 ## Part 1: Build a Brushed DC electrical motor  
  
 ### Step 1- Build a commutator  
    
    The basic purpose of commutation is to ensure that the torque acting on the armature  
    is always in the same direction.

 ### Step 2- Add Support Shaft
  
    This means that the motor can rest on top of supprt pins to rotate.
    
 ### Step 3- Wind the armature coil
  
     The armature interacts with the magnetic field (magnetic flux).

 ### Step 4- Build the Shaft support and magnet brackets/ Step 5- Build the baseplate

 ## Part 2 Test The Motor
  
  ### Step 1 - Finish the motor
  
  ### Step 2 - Test the motor

# lab 3- Incremental Encoder

## Part 1 introduction principle of operation
  
  an motor encoder is a rotary encoder which is attach to a motor, this create a feed back loop to provide  
  inforamtion on the speed or position od the motor shaft.
  
  For the coursework the enocder we used was a disc with cut out even segments which when an light source was  
  used it would pass through the gaps and hit a photo detector this would then shown that it had been hit.  
  when this occurs continusly a code would be able to pin point the rough speed and shaft position. 
  
  ### Step 1 - Circuit Diagram

### Step 2 - Build the IR LED light source

### Step 3 - Build the light detector

    when the path is blocked, the tranasistor will turn off and the voltage across the emitter and collector  
    will rise to almost the supply voltage. the code will monitor this to access the data.

### Step 4 - Place an encoder dic on the motor

## Part 2 Arduino

### Step 1- Launch the Arduino IDE

### Step 2- Connectt your encoder

### Step 3- Calcu;late the angualr velcocity of your motor

## part 3- Components
